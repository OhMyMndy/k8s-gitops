## Overview

## Secret Management

Secrets are managed by `bin/secrets.sh`. Below is a short description of
the commands and the two types of files that are automatically generated.
All secrets are able to use environment variables from `.secrets.env` which
is secured by git-crypt.

Refreshing of secrets have the caveat of only knowing if the source file is
newer than the sealed secret. This does not account for changes to
`.secrets.env` that affect the secret. If changes are made to existing values
you will need to touch the secret[s] affected or remove their sealed secret
counterparts.

Secrets are generated into `cluster/secrets`. The `kustomization.yaml`
is automatically generated to contain them all. Each secret exists in their
respective namespace which is extracted from the `kustomization.yaml` within
the same directory the secret exists in.

As an added bonus there is a pre-commit hook to ensure all sealed secrets
exist and are up to date so that you do not forget to generate any new ones.

### Secret Commands

* `./bin/secrets.sh check` -  ensures all `SealedSecret` resources exist
* `./bin/secrets.sh refresh` -  create & update any secrets necessary
* `./bin/secrets.sh write` -  recreate all secrets
* `./bin/secrets.sh wipe` -  destroy all `SealedSecret` resources

### Secret Types

#### `secret-name.secrets.yaml`

> yaml file to be used as the data: for the secret. All values
> within these types of secrets must be base64 encoded. The secret
> name is the name of the file less the secrets.yaml suffix.

#### `secret-name.values.yaml`

> this is for `HelmRelease` style values. They will generate a secret
> with a `values.yaml` key containing the contents of this file. The
> secret generated will be named `secret-name-values`.
